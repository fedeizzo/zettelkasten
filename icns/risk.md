# Risk
Risk is the possibility that a particular security threat will exploit a system vulnerability.
Risk also highlight the impact over the system which is attacked through the exploit and the likelihood of occurrences. We can measure the risk analyzing loss of confidentiality, integrity or availability.

## Vulnerability
A vulnerability is a weakness in an system that could be exploited or triggered by a threat source, an exploitation, a misuse or through system security policy violation.

## Threat
A circumstance or event with the potential to adversely impact over a system via:

* unauthorized access;
* destruction of information;
* disclosure of information;
* modification of information;
* denial of service;
* exploit a particular system vulnerability.

## Security policy

## Security service
A capability that supports one, or more, of the security requirements (CIA trade). For example: key management, access control, authentication, etc.
